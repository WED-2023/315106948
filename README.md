# Dolly Parton Website

This project is a website dedicated to the legendary singer, songwriter, and philanthropist **Dolly Parton**. The website includes various sections that explore Dollyâ€™s life, career, and impact on music, culture, and beyond.

I chose a **simple and classic design** for the website. The layout is clean, with easy navigation, and each section is designed to highlight different aspects of her journey and legacy.

Additionally, I designed a **logo that represents her unique style**, which reflects both her country roots and glamorous persona.
